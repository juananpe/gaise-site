# Generative AI for Software Engineering

Welcome to **GAISE** - your comprehensive guide to understanding and leveraging generative artificial intelligence in software development.

## Course Overview

This course explores the transformative impact of AI on software engineering, covering everything from code generation tools to ethical considerations in AI-assisted development.

## Featured Case Study

- [Cómo usar herramientas IA para descompilar y arreglar un error en un binario Java](/posts/ai-reverse-engineering-java-bug/) - A real-world example of using Claude and Cursor to reverse engineer and fix a 10-year-old Java application bug
- [Using Claude Code to modernize a 25-year-old kernel driver](https://dmitrybrant.com/2025/09/07/using-claude-code-to-modernize-a-25-year-old-kernel-driver) - How Claude Code resurrected a 25-year-old Linux kernel driver for legacy tape drives, enabling it to work on modern systems

## Course Materials

- [LangChain AI Agents Using Contextual Engineering](https://github.com/FareedKhan-dev/contextual-engineering-guide) - This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to implement the four core strategies of contextual engineering—Write, Select, Compress, and Isolate—using LangChain and LangGraph, covering everything from scratchpad memory and RAG-based knowledge retrieval to context summarization and multi-agent architectures with isolated context windows.
